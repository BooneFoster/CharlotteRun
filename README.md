Feedback

● Review #1
1. Unable to find brand page - I was able to fix the spreadsheet and provide a more
accurate link to the project site.
2. Missing Pages - Pages were there, they were just improperly linked, but it has
been fixed.
● Review #2
1. Background image to bright - I was able to fix this by changing the background
image to something darker to contrast better with the navigation bar.
2. No h1 text - I changed this to appropriately hold an h1.
3. No footer- I added a footer component and linked it into all pages.
4. No main tag - I added a <main> tag to all pages.


Reflection
I believe that after sitting down and showing my client the website and it’s intricacies that
my site has met all the specific needs of my client. He is very pleased with how it turned out and
he is aware that I can make styling changes anytime as well as add functionality if he gives me a
description. As for future plans we would like to add an email list that you can sign up for upon
visiting the home page, however I will need to mess around with some more plugins to actually
receive the users email and store it and then send mass emails to that list. We would also like to
expand the website's homepage a little so that people can leave reviews which would help us get
even more feedback! Overall I believe the website was a success, but still has more potential!
